Thank you for visiting our website (the "Site"). By using this Site, you ("you", "your") accept these terms and conditions (the "Terms"). If You do not accept these Terms, do not use this Site. This site is operated by Mind One Digital Limited, a private company limited by shares and Incorporated and Registered in Scotland No SC401083 and whose Registered Address is 4th Floor, 115 George Street, Edinburgh, EH2 4JN, United Kingdom ("we", "us", "our"). By purchasing any product through this Site (the "Product" or "Products"), You agree to the following Terms. <br>
<br>
Full Disclaimer<br>
<br>
1) Every effort has been made to design The Site and Products to be useful, informative, helpful, honest and fun and to accurately represent the Product and its potential.  However, as is naturally the case, each person's success depends upon his/her dedication to the program, their background, commitment and many other factors. Your level of success in attaining the results claimed in our materials depends on the time you devote to the program, ideas and techniques mentioned, your knowledge and the various skills which we mention in our Products. Since these factors differ according to the individual, we cannot guarantee individual success or determine your results.<br>
<br>
2) Information, our Products and content on our Site have not been evaluated by any independent or government body or entity.  None of our Products are intended to treat, diagnose, cure or prevent any disease, dysfunction or condition, mental or physical, in any way whatsoever. None of the information or Products on our Site should be regarded as medical advice in any way whatsoever.<br>
<br>
3) BrainTune® technology and any of our Products should not be used if you suffer from epilepsy, if you have a serious mental disorder, if you are pregnant, if you are prone to seizures, if you wear a pacemaker, if you are photosensitive, or if you are under the influence of medication or drugs.

<br>
4) We recommend that users of our Products are aged 18 years and over. <br>
<br>
5) Materials in our Products and our Site may contain information that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as "anticipate", "estimate", "expect", "project", "intend", "plan", "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with a description of potential intelligence gains or intellectual performance. These forward looking statements do not guarantee that you will receive similar gains in intellectual performance. <br>
<br>
6) Unless stated otherwise, scientific research, institutions and individuals mentioned on our Site are not connected to or affiliated with Mind One Digital Limited, our information or our Products in any way whatsoever. The research and information is only presented to illustrate that there is scientific research on the topic of cognition and for the purpose of adding to your understanding of some aspects of the content on our Site. Any research referenced may be erroneous or have gross omissions and by accepting these Terms, you confirm that you understand that we in no way warrant the validity of said information. All information and research provided is provided on an "as is" basis.<br>
<br>
7) Some of our techniques and methods have no or limited researched scientific basis and should therefore be regarded as solely the opinion of Mind One Digital Ltd. These techniques are based on our own in-house research regarding the results you can expect.  <br>
<br>
8) The testimonials / endorsements included on our Site abide by word of mouth marketing standards. All of our testimonials display standard and realistic results you can expect from the program. However, these results shown do not guarantee that you will experience similar results. Every person's success depends on his/her background, dedication, motivation and many other factors. <br>

This does not affect any of our other rights outlined in other clauses of these Terms, or other remedies under these Terms.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, all images used on this Site or any of our literature, Products and services are either owned by us, or licensed to us. If at any time it is found that the validity of a license on an image is in question, we have no liability, whether financial or otherwise to anyone whatsoever for any reason. We will also only deal exclusively with the copyright holder of an image to discuss any queries and not any of their "agents", even if the copyright holder chooses to designate such "agents" through agreements between the agent and copyright holder. Any agreement between a copyright holder and their agent is strictly between the copyright holder and the agent, and therefore does not affect our right to communicate directly and exclusively with the copyright holder alone. The copyright holder is defined as the person who is the copyright owner of the work in question. An agent is defined as any entity besides the copyright holder, who deals, negotiates or communicates on behalf or for the copyright holder.

In a case where the validity of a license on a technology is in question, we will have no liability, financial or otherwise to anyone whatsoever for any reason. We will also only communicate directly with the patent holder to discuss any queries and not any of their agents or intermediaries, even if the patent holder chooses to designate such agents through agreements between the patent holder and the agent. Any agreement between the patent holder and agent is exclusively between the patent holder and the agent, and does not affect our rights in anyway, to be able and have the right to communicate directly and exclusively with the patent holder alone. The patent holder is defined as the person or organisation who are the registered patent owner of the technology in question in the jurisdictions where the patent applies. An agent is defined as any entity besides the patents holder, who deals, negotiates or communicates on behalf or for the patent holder. Finally, any patent holder will need to prove that they are the patent holder before we can embark on any negotiations or discussions.<br>
<br>
By reading these Terms or accessing anything on our Site or any of our literature, you agree to the terms of this clause and all other clauses in these Terms.<br>
<br>
Contract creation and electronic contracting<br>
<br>
The technical steps required to create the contract between you and us, in the case of Products ordered from our Site are as follows:<br>
<br>
1) You place the order for your Product(s) on the Site by pressing the 'checkout button' at the end of the shopping cart process and having confirmed your acceptance of the End User License Agreement. You will then be transferred to our payment processor, PayPal, who will guide you through the financial transaction process. After this transaction is verified by PayPal, you are transferred back to our Site. <br>
<br>
2) PayPal or us will send to you an order acknowledgement email detailing the Product(s) you have ordered. This is sent to the e-mail address entered in PayPal.<br>
 <br>
3) Completion of the contract between you and us will take place at the time of your acceptance of the EULA and when you receive any notification or receipt from either us or PayPal that your Product(s) order has taken place, or has been received, verified or completed. Acceptance does not occur when we have notified you that we do not accept your order and you have yet to download the Product(s).<br>
<br>
We will take all reasonable care, in so far as it is in our power to do so, to keep the details of your order and payment secure, but in the absence of negligence on our part we cannot be held liable for any loss you may suffer if a third party procures unauthorised access to any data you provide when accessing or ordering from the Site.<br>
<br>
Policy for refunds under the 60-day money back guarantee<br>
<br>
The 60-day money back guarantee applies when a customer buys our Products. We will honour all refund requests sent to us, as we are an honest, credible and reliable organisation with the highest standards of integrity. Exceptions to the refund policy can be requested, but this must be through written agreement with us. <br>
<br>
Our standard policy is as follows: <br>
1) The customer must send us their receipt, full name and e-mail address within 60 days of purchasing the Product in order to receive a full refund. The customer may also be required to fill out a short questionnaire, which will help us to improve our Products and services. 
2) Refunds requested due to the inability of the customer to open and read our Products, the audios, or any of our Products will not be accepted. It is the customer's responsibility to ensure that they possess the required software and hardware specifications in order to access and read our Products. The Product should always be accessible if Adobe® Reader® Version 7.0 or greater is used. The Product is also accessible on both Mac and Windows operating systems. 
3) It is the customer's responsibility to ensure that they have read the Policy for Refunds under the 60-day money back guarantee. 
4) Any further disputes between ourselves and the customer will be dealt with under our procedures which are highlighted above in the Terms.<br>
<br>
Severance<br>
If any part of the Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed to be severable from the Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any of the remaining provisions of the Terms.<br>
<br>
Survival<br>
Each provision of the Terms shall be construed as separately applying and surviving even if for any reason one or other of those provisions is held to be inapplicable or unenforceable in any circumstances.<br>
<br>
Entire agreement
These Terms govern our relationship with you. Any changes to these Terms must be in writing and signed by both parties. In this way we can avoid any problems surrounding what both parties are expected to do. You confirm that, in agreeing to accept the Terms, you have not relied on any representation save insofar as the same has expressly been made a condition of these Terms and you agree that you shall have no remedy in respect of any representation. Your Statutory Rights are not affected by these Terms. Nothing in this Clause shall limit or exclude our liability in respect of any fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation whether or not such has become a condition of the Terms.<br>
<br>
Jurisdiction and Other Points to Consider <br>
<br>
If you use our Site from locations outside of the United Kingdom, you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. <br>
<br>
These Terms shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of Scotland (and regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under conflicts of law) as to all matters, including but not limited to matters of validity, construction, effect, performance and remedy and you irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Scotland.<br>
<br>
To the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our and/or its affiliates' intellectual property rights, Mind One Digital and/or its affiliates may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any court within Scotland of the United Kingdom. <br>
<br>
We reserve the right to modify these Terms, and the agreement they create, at any time, simply by updating this posting and without notice to you. <br>
